- **SAS Code**

```{}
proc iml;
/*create 3x4 matrix*/
reset print;
x={4 5 1 2,
   1 0 3 5,
   2 1 8 2};
quit;
```

- SAS output for X matrix shown below:

- **R Code**

```{r}
mymatrix <- matrix(c(4,1,2,5,0,1,1,3,8,2,5,2),nrow=3,ncol=4)
print(mymatrix)
```

- **Python Code**

```{}
import numpy as np
x = np.matrix([[4,5,1,2],[1,0,3,5],[2,1,8,2]])
print x
```

 - Python output (Ipython Notebook):

### Question 2

- **Answer the following questions for Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. stock (symbol = `ADP`):**


- **1.) Download the data.**


- **2.) Calculate log returns.**


- **3.) Calculate volatility measure.**


- **4.) Calculate volatility over entire length of series for various three different decay factors.**


- **5.) Plot the results, overlaying the volatility curves on the data, just as was done in the S&P example.**

### Question 3

- The built-in data set called `Orange` in R is about the growth of orange trees. The `Orange` data frame has 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees.

**Variable description**

- *Tree*: an ordered factor indicating the tree on which the measurement is made. The ordering  is according to increasing maximum diameter.

- *age*: a numeric vector giving the age of the tree (days since 1968/12/31) circumference: a numeric vector of trunk circumferences (mm). This is probably “circumference at breast height”, a standard measurement in forestry.

- First, let's load the `Orange` data set into a data frame and examine the structure of the data:
```{r}
#Read in Orange dataset from R into data.frame
df <- data.frame(Orange)
```

```{r}
#Return first 5 rows of Orange df
head(df)
```

```{r}
#get summary of Orange dataset
summary(df)
```

```{r}
#get structure of each columns
str(df$Tree)
str(df$age)
str(df$circumference)
```

- **a) Calculate the mean and the median of the trunk circumferences for different size of the trees. (Tree)**

```{r}
#aggregate data.frame by Tree and compute mean circumference
circum.mean <- aggregate(df$circumference,by=list(df$Tree),FUN=mean)
colnames(circum.mean) <- c("Tree","Avg Circumference")
circum.mean
```

```{r}
#aggregate data.frame by Tree and compute median circumference
circum.median <- aggregate(df$circumference,by=list(df$Tree),FUN=median)
colnames(circum.median) <- c("Tree","Med. Circumference")
circum.median
```

- **b) Make a scatter plot of the trunk circumferences against the age of the tree. Use different plotting symbols for different size of trees.**

```{r}
#Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

#Scatter plot 
p <- ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(y=df$circumference,x=df$age,colour=df$Tree)) +
  scale_colour_hue(l=80, c=150)
p + labs(title="Scatter Plot \n Age vs Circumference by Tree",x="Age",y="Circumference",
         colour="Tree")
```

```{r}
# Line plot
p <- ggplot(df,aes(y=df$circumference,x=df$age,colour=df$Tree)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(size=1,alpha=0.8) + scale_colour_hue(h=c(180, 270))
p + labs(title="Line Plot \n Age vs Circumference by Tree",x="Age",y="Circumference",
         colour="Tree")
```


- **c) Display the trunk circumferences on a comparative boxplot against tree. Be sure you order the boxplots in the increasing order of maximum diameter.**

```{r}
#Determine the max circum by each group and reorder the levels accordingly 
circum.max <- aggregate(df$circumference,by=list(df$Tree),FUN=max)#aggregate for max circum
colnames(circum.max) <- c("Tree","Max Circum.") #rename columns
circum.max
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
factor(df$Tree,c("3","1","5","2","4")) #reorder the boxplot for max circum. by tree
```

```{r}
p<-ggplot(df,aes(x=Tree,y=circumference))+ geom_boxplot(aes(fill=Tree))# ggplot: boxplot 
p + labs(title="Box Plot: Trunk Circumference", y="Circumference",x="Tree")
```

### Question 4

- **1.)	First, d ownload “Temp” data set. Find the difference between the maximum and the minimum monthly average temperatures for each country and report/visualize top 20 countries with the maximum differences for the period since 1900.**


- **2.) Select a subset of data called “UStemp” where US land temperatures from 01/01/1990 in Temp data. Use UStemp dataset to answer the followings.**

  - **a) Create a new column to display the monthly average land temperatures in Fahrenheit (°F).**
  
  - **b) Calculate average land temperature by year and plot it. The original file has the average land temperature by month.** 
  
  - **c) Calculate the one year difference of average land temperature by year and provide the maximum difference (value) with corresponding two years.**


- **3.) Download “CityTemp” data set. Find the difference between the maximum and the minimum temperatures for each major city and report/visualize top 20 cities with maximum differences for the period since 1900.**

- **4.) Compare the two graphs in (i) and (iii)  and comment it.**
